# Introduction
The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a numerical value that represents overall air quality. This project aims to analyze the AQI of Delhi using Python, following a systematic approach to data analysis.
# Data Collection
The dataset used for this analysis contains hourly air quality measurements from various pollutants in Delhi for January 2023. You can download the dataset fromÂ here.
# Data Preprocessing
Import necessary libraries.
Load the dataset and convert the date column to a datetime data type.
Display descriptive statistics of the dataset.
AQI Calculation
The AQI is calculated based on the concentration of various pollutants. The following steps are taken:
Define AQI breakpoints and corresponding AQI values for different pollutants.
Create functions to calculate the AQI for each pollutant and the overall AQI for each row in the dataset.
Categorize the AQI into different categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).
# Data Visualization
Various visualizations are created to represent the AQI and pollutant concentrations:
Time series plots for each air pollutant.
Bar charts for AQI over time and AQI category distribution.
Donut plots for pollutant concentrations.
Correlation heatmaps between pollutants.
Hourly average AQI trends.
Average AQI by day of the week.
# Analysis Results
The analysis reveals trends in air quality, pollutant concentrations, and correlations between different pollutants. It also highlights the days with the worst air quality in Delhi.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to analyze the Air Quality Index of a specific location using Python. The findings can help inform public health decisions and environmental management strategies. For any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out in the comments section.
